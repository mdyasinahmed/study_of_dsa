Number theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the properties and relationships of numbers, especially integers. It has significant applications in computer science and cryptography, and it’s a common subject in programming interviews, particularly for positions that require a strong understanding of algorithms and optimization. Here are some popular number theory concepts that are frequently covered in interview preparation:

### 1. **Prime Numbers**
   - **Primality Testing**: Determining whether a number is a prime.
   - **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: An efficient algorithm for finding all primes smaller than a given limit.

### 2. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**
   - **Euclidean Algorithm**: An efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor of two integers.
   - **Extended Euclidean Algorithm**: Also finds coefficients of Bézout's identity, which are integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b) \).

### 3. **Modular Arithmetic**
   - **Modular Exponentiation**: Computing \( a^b \mod c \) efficiently.
   - **Applications**: Used in cryptography like RSA, and in computing hash functions.

### 4. **Fermat’s Little Theorem**
   - Useful for computing inverses modulo \( p \) (when \( p \) is prime) and in primality testing.

### 5. **Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**
   - Solves systems of simultaneous linear congruences with different moduli.
   - Application in algorithms that need to handle multiple congruences efficiently.

### 6. **Euler’s Totient Function**
   - **Euler's Phi Function**: Counts the number of integers up to \( n \) that are coprime to \( n \).
   - Useful for finding the order of groups in cryptography and in computing modular inverses.

### 7. **Factorization**
   - **Trial Division**: Simple method by checking divisibility.
   - **Pollard’s Rho Algorithm**: A probabilistic factorization algorithm useful for large numbers.

### 8. **Diophantine Equations**
   - Equations of the form \( ax + by = c \) where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are integers, and solutions are sought in integers.
   - Includes linear as well as more complex equations like quadratic Diophantine equations.

### 9. **Pell’s Equation**
   - A specific type of quadratic Diophantine equation of the form \( x^2 - Dy^2 = 1 \).
   - Techniques involve continued fractions and are useful in certain cryptographic and algorithmic applications.

### 10. **Number Theoretic Functions**
   - Functions such as the **Möbius function** and **Mertens function** that are used to analyze number theoretic properties and solve summation problems involving divisors or primes.

### 11. **Wilson’s Theorem**
   - A theorem stating that a natural number \( p \) greater than 1 is a prime number if and only if \((p-1)! \equiv -1 \mod p\).

### 12. **Legendre and Jacobi Symbols**
   - Used in quadratic reciprocity and other advanced number theory topics, particularly in solving quadratic residues and non-residues.

### 13. **Pythagorean Triples**
   - Sets of three positive integers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) that fit the formula \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \).
   - Relevant in problems involving geometry and trigonometry.

### 14. **Perfect Numbers**
   - Integers that are the sum of their positive divisors, excluding themselves.
   - Related concepts include **amicable numbers** and **sociable numbers**.

### 15. **Cryptography**
   - Concepts like **public key cryptography**, **RSA algorithm**, and **elliptic curve cryptography** rely heavily on number theory.
